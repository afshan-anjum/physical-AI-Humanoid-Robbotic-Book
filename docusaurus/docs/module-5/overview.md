# Module 5: Humanoid Development Overview

This module is dedicated to the intricate process of humanoid robot development. Building and programming robots that walk, interact, and perform tasks in human environments presents unique engineering and AI challenges. You will learn about:

*   **Humanoid Kinematics and Dynamics**: Understanding the complex movements and forces involved.
*   **Balance and Gait Control**: Algorithms for stable bipedal locomotion.
*   **Whole-Body Control**: Coordinating multiple joints for complex tasks.
*   **Sensor Integration for Humanoids**: Using vision, force, and IMU data for perception and control.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction**: Designing intuitive and safe interaction methods.

This module brings together many concepts from previous modules, focusing them on the specialized needs of humanoid platforms.
