# Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary provides definitions for important terms used throughout the "AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook". Understanding these terms is crucial for grasping the concepts presented in each module.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with its overall body shape built to resemble the human body, such as having a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for describing all elements of a robot. It is commonly used in ROS to describe the kinematic and dynamic properties of a robot, as well as its visual representation.

**Note**: This glossary will be continually updated and expanded with new terms as they are introduced in the textbook content.
