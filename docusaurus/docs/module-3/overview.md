# Module 3: Gazebo Overview

This module will guide you through using Gazebo, a powerful 3D robot simulator. Gazebo allows you to accurately and efficiently simulate complex robotic environments without needing physical hardware. You will learn about:

*   **Gazebo Interface**: Navigating the simulation environment and interacting with models.
*   **Creating Worlds**: Designing and populating custom simulation environments.
*   **Robot Modeling (URDF/SDF)**: Describing robot kinematics, dynamics, and sensors.
*   **ROS 2 and Gazebo Integration**: Controlling simulated robots using ROS 2.

Simulated robotics is a critical step in developing and testing complex AI and control algorithms. Let's get started!
