# Module 6: Conversational Robotics and Capstone Project Overview

This final module brings together all the knowledge you've gained throughout the textbook. We will first explore the exciting field of conversational robotics, focusing on how humanoid robots can interact naturally with humans using natural language processing and generation. The culmination of this textbook will be a capstone project, where you will apply your skills to design and implement a comprehensive AI and robotics solution.

## Conversational Robotics

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Integrating large language models (LLMs) with robot control.
*   **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Enabling robots to understand and generate human-like speech.
*   **Dialogue Management**: Creating coherent and context-aware robot-human interactions.

## Capstone Project

*   **Project Design**: Defining scope, requirements, and architecture for your final project.
*   **Implementation**: Applying principles from ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, and Humanoid Development.
*   **Testing and Validation**: Ensuring your integrated solution works as expected.
*   **Documentation**: Presenting your project effectively.

This module is your opportunity to synthesize your learning and create something truly innovative!
