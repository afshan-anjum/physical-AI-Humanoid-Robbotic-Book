# Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Overview

This module delves into NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a powerful robotics simulation platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse. Isaac Sim provides photorealistic, physically accurate simulation environments crucial for developing and testing AI-powered robots, especially humanoids. You will learn about:

*   **Isaac Sim Environment**: Setting up and navigating the Omniverse-based simulator.
*   **Asset Management**: Importing and creating robotic assets within Isaac Sim.
*   **ROS 2 Bridge**: Seamlessly connecting Isaac Sim with your ROS 2 applications.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Training AI agents for complex robotic tasks within the simulation.

Leverage the power of GPU-accelerated simulation to rapidly prototype and validate your humanoid AI designs!
