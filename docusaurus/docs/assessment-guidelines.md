# Assessment Guidelines

This section provides an overview of the assessment methods and criteria for evaluating your progress and understanding throughout the "AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook". The goal is to ensure you not only grasp theoretical concepts but also gain practical skills in implementing AI and robotics solutions.

## General Principles

*   **Practical Application**: Emphasis will be placed on your ability to apply learned concepts in practical scenarios, often through coding exercises and simulation tasks.
*   **Problem-Solving**: Assessments will challenge your problem-solving skills, encouraging you to debug, iterate, and refine your solutions.
*   **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation of your code, design choices, and experimental results will be a key part of every assessment.

## Assessment Components

### 1. Module Quizzes/Challenges

*   **Format**: Short multiple-choice quizzes or small coding challenges at the end of each module.
*   **Purpose**: To test your comprehension of core concepts before moving to the next module.

### 2. Practical Exercises

*   **Format**: Hands-on coding tasks, robot simulation experiments (using Gazebo, Isaac Sim), or control algorithm implementations.
*   **Purpose**: To build practical skills and reinforce theoretical knowledge. These often involve submitting code or simulation files.

### 3. Capstone Project (Module 6)

*   **Format**: A culminating project where you design, implement, and document a complete AI and robotics solution, integrating concepts from across multiple modules.
*   **Purpose**: To demonstrate mastery of the textbook's content and your ability to work on a larger, more complex problem. This may involve hardware if available.

## Grading Criteria

Assessments will typically be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness**: Does the solution meet all functional requirements?
*   **Efficiency**: Is the solution optimized for performance (computation, memory)?
*   **Robustness**: How well does the solution handle edge cases and errors?
*   **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, adherence to coding standards.
*   **Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of explanations, comments, and reports.

**Note**: Specific rubrics and deadlines for each assessment will be detailed within their respective module sections.
