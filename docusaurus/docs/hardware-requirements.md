# Recommended Hardware for Practical Exercises

This section outlines the hardware components and specifications recommended to fully engage with the practical exercises in this textbook. While many concepts can be understood theoretically, hands-on experience with the right hardware will significantly enhance your learning.

## Robotics Platform

*   **Humanoid Robot Kit**: (e.g., Robotis OP3, Unitree Go1 - specific model to be determined)
    *   Minimum 18 degrees of freedom (DoF)
    *   Onboard computing (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Orin)
    *   Integrated sensors (IMU, camera, force sensors)

## Computing Environment

*   **Workstation/Laptop**:
    *   **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended for ROS 2 compatibility)
    *   **Processor**: Intel i7 (10th Gen or newer) / AMD Ryzen 7 (3000 series or newer)
    *   **RAM**: 16GB (minimum), 32GB (recommended)
    *   **Storage**: 500GB SSD (minimum)
    *   **Graphics Card**: NVIDIA GPU (RTX 20 series or newer) with at least 8GB VRAM (required for Isaac Sim and advanced AI tasks)

## Peripherals & Tools

*   **Power Supply**: Stable 12V/10A (or as per robot specs)
*   **Networking**: WiFi 5GHz, Ethernet (for direct robot connection)
*   **Basic Tool Kit**: Screwdrivers, wrenches, multimeter, breadboard, jumper wires.

## Software

*   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
*   **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill**
*   **Gazebo Simulator**
*   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**
*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **Docker**
*   **VS Code** (with relevant extensions for Python, ROS 2, etc.)
