# AI/Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Progressive Learning Structure
Content must follow a clear, progressive learning structure, starting from foundational basics and gradually advancing to complex topics. Each chapter should build upon the previous one to ensure a smooth learning curve.

### II. Hands-On Examples
The textbook must be rich with practical, hands-on examples and executable code snippets. All code should be verified to be working and directly relevant to the concepts being taught.

### III. Comprehensive Topic Coverage
The curriculum must provide comprehensive coverage of core AI and Robotics topics, including the Foundation of Physical AI, ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Humanoid Robot Development, Conversational Robotics, and a final Capstone Project.

### IV. Student-Centric Explanations
Explanations must be student-friendly, intuitive, and connected to real-world applications. The material should be written to inspire curiosity and make complex topics approachable.

### V. Documentation and Formatting Standards
All content must adhere to strict documentation standards and consistent formatting. This includes a uniform style for code, diagrams, and textual content to maintain professional quality and readability.

### VI. Accessibility and Readability
The material must be designed for accessibility and readability, catering to diverse learning backgrounds. This includes using clear language, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring the digital format is screen-reader friendly.
