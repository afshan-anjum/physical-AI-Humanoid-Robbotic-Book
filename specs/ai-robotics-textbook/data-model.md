# Data Model (Content Frontmatter)

Since this project is a static Docusaurus site, the data model primarily consists of the frontmatter structure for our Markdown (`.md` and `.mdx`) content files. A consistent frontmatter is crucial for SEO, navigation, and rendering metadata on the page.

## Chapter/Page Frontmatter

All content pages within the `docs/` directory should include the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
# SEO & Metadata
title: "The Title of the Chapter"
description: "A brief one-sentence summary of the chapter's content. Used for SEO."
keywords:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
  - humanoid robotics
  - ROS 2

# Docusaurus-specific
# Automatically generated by the file-based routing, but can be overridden.
# id: unique-id-for-this-page 
slug: /module-1/chapter-title # Overrides the default URL if needed

# Custom Metadata
learning_objectives:
  - "Objective 1: Understand the core concepts of X."
  - "Objective 2: Learn how to implement Y using Python."
  - "Objective 3: Analyze the trade-offs between A and B."
prerequisites:
  - "Basic Python knowledge"
  - "Completion of Module 1"
---
```

### Field Definitions

-   **`title`** (string, required): The main title of the page, displayed in the sidebar, breadcrumbs, and as the `<h1>`.
-   **`description`** (string, required): A short summary used in HTML `<meta>` tags for search engine results.
-   **`keywords`** (array of strings, optional): A list of relevant keywords for SEO.
-   **`slug`** (string, optional): If you want to customize the URL slug. By default, Docusaurus uses the file path.
-   **`learning_objectives`** (array of strings, optional): A list of specific, measurable learning goals for the chapter. This custom metadata can be rendered by a React component.
-   **`prerequisites`** (array of strings, optional): A list of required knowledge or completed chapters before starting the current one. This can also be rendered by a custom component.

## Module Category Metadata

To give a module a custom label in the sidebar, a `_category_.json` file will be created in each module's directory.

**Example**: `docs/module-1/_category_.json`

```json
{
  "label": "Module 1: The Foundation",
  "position": 1,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "description": "Learn the fundamentals of Physical AI and the landscape of humanoid robotics."
  }
}
```

### Field Definitions

-   **`label`** (string, required): The display name for the module in the sidebar.
-   **`position`** (number, required): The order of the module in the sidebar.
-   **`link`** (object, optional): Creates a clickable overview page for the module.

This structured approach to content metadata will ensure consistency and enable powerful, automated rendering of learning aids throughout the textbook.
